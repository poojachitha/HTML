                    The eternal flame at a war memorial in the Indian capital, Delhi,
                    has been put out and merged with a newer flame.<br>
                </strong>

                The Amar Jawan Jyoti, which has been burning for more than five decades
                to honour the martyrs of the armed forces, was merged on Friday with a
                newer flame located less than 400m away in the newly built National War Memorial.<br>
